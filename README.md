# Copy Section

This plugin adds a "copy" button to `# Header` lines within the document. Clicking the button will copy everything
within that section (eg: up to the next `# Header` line of the same level). Data is copied as raw markdown.

## Features

- Allows you to easily copy entire sections
- Optionally omit `%%comments%%` or lines containing only `#tags`
- Copy all sub-sections, or only up to the next `# Header` line of any level
- Choose which levels you want the copy button to appear on
